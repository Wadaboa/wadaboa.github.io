# **About Me** <span><a href="https://github.com/Wadaboa/cv-resume/raw/master/cv.pdf" class="btn btn-info" id="cv-button">CV</a></span>

:bust_in_silhouette: Hi, I’m Alessio, currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon, where I focus on advancing speech generation technologies for Alexa and beyond. My work spans from research to production of deep learning models, with a keen interest in multilingual and multimodal systems. I’m also a firm believer in open science and enjoy every step of the publication process, from writing impactful papers to presenting results at international conferences. 

:robot: On the engineering side, I remember falling in love with the words of Kernighan and Ritchie in their famous book of C (the programming language), while being in middle school. Since then, I’ve been experimenting with programming, tinkering with computer science and developing a great passion in Linux and open-source software overall. Over the years, I’ve grown a strong foundation in machine learning frameworks, cloud platforms, and software engineering principles, and I’m always excited to dive deeper into new challenges and technologies.
