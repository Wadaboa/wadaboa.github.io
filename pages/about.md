# **About Me** <span><a href="https://github.com/Wadaboa/cv-resume/raw/master/cv.pdf" class="btn btn-info" id="cv-button">CV</a></span>

Hello there, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:.<br>

I'm a full-time learner and I've been studying and experimenting with ICT and Computer Science since childhood :keyboard:.

I graduated with honours from the University of Florence and I decided to pursue my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at University of Bologna, where I'm currently enrolled :mortar_board:.

I hope that my strong interest in this emerging field, along with my entrepreneurship, will enable me to find my spot and successfully kick-start a career in AI :robot:.

I work well on a team, or as a freelancer (inventing and implementing) to design algorithms, frameworks and create desktop applications, websites and web services using the tools available and the knowledge, skills and competencies I'm constantly developing and improving :bulb:.

I also enjoy modeling problems and solve them using both well-tested and cutting-edge AI techniques :bar_chart:.

I'm an avid Apple user and I have a great passion in Linux and open source software overall :penguin:.

I'm always studying, learning and looking for new technologies, new ideas and possibilities.
Always in the hunt for more Computer Science, AI, Photography and English studies :books:.

In my future I would love to spend some time working, studying or just exploring America, Canada, Australia and Japan :airplane:.
